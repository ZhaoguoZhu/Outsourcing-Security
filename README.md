# Sentence Clustering: Clustering DOD documents using Sentence Transformers / Hierarchical Agglomerative Algorithm / LDA

This repository provides an easying method of clustering sentences based on semantic similarity. Sentences are embedded using transformers, clustered by hierarchical agglomerative algorithm and eventually each cluster is given name based on repeat of important words by LDA. To apply our program, you will be only using file in the 'src' folder. Other files in the repository are for testing and research purposes.


Original project idea came from Dr. Kaija Schilde and the process was supervized under Professor Dharmesh Tarapore from the Boston University Spark Engineering Community. @Professor Tarapore: for grading purposes, please also only look at the files at the 'src' folder and follow the guideline below.


The contents of the code orginates from the UKPLab, please refer to our citation and links in the files and below.
